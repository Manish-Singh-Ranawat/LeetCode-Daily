// Find the Minimum Amount of Time to Brew Potions - https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-amount-of-time-to-brew-potions/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-10-09

// You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.

// In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the ith wizard on the jth potion is timeij = skill[i] * mana[j].

// Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹

// Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.

// Input: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]
// Output: 110
// Explanation:
// Potion Number	Start time	 Wizard 0 done by	Wizard 1 done by	Wizard 2 done by	Wizard 3 done by
//       0	            0	           5	               30	               40	              60
//       1	            52	           53	               58	               60	              64
//       2	            54	           58	               78	               86	              102
//       3	            86	           88	               98	               102	              110
// As an example for why wizard 0 cannot start working on the 1st potion before time t = 52, consider the case where the wizards started preparing the 1st potion at time t = 50. At time t = 58, wizard 2 is done with the 1st potion, but wizard 3 will still be working on the 0th potion till time t = 60.
